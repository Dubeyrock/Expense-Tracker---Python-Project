# Expense-Tracker -Python-Project
In this Python project, we will build a GUI-based Expense Tracker using the Tkinter, Tkcalender, and SQLite libraries and the message box and Ttk modules of the Tkinter library. It is an intermediate-level project, where you will learn a lot about databases and GUIs and apply them in real life.

This is a Python-based Expense Tracker application built using Tkinter, Tkcalendar, SQLite, and the Ttk modules. The application allows users to track their expenses, view the history of transactions, and store all relevant information like payee and the reason for payment. Itâ€™s an intermediate-level project to help you master GUI development, databases, and event handling in Python.

## Project Overview
An Expense Tracker is a desktop application that allows users to:

Keep track of their expenses.
Store data like the person to whom the payment was made (Payee) and the reason for the payment.
View, add, and delete records of expenses.
This project uses a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to make the interaction easy and efficient for users.

## Key Features:
**Add Expense:** Add new expense records with details such as the amount, date, category, and payee.
**View Expenses:** Display all expenses in a table with date and category.
**Delete Expense:** Remove unwanted or incorrect expense records.
**Search Expenses:** Search for specific expenses based on categories or payees.
**Date Selection:** Use a calendar widget for easy date selection.

## Technologies Used

**Tkinter:** Used to create the graphical user interface.
**Tkcalender:** Used for date selection in the GUI.
**SQLite:** Used to manage and store expense data in a database.
**Ttk.Treeview:** Used to display expenses in a table format.
